The ParadisEO framework is required to run this optimization problem. 
ParadisEO 1.3-beta2 is used, see http://paradiseo.gforge.inria.fr/ for 
more information and to download/install.

Note: It is also required to copy some directories/files in the 
ParadisEO installation. The following directories have to be copied, or 
files from the directory in case the directory already exists: 
	eval, explorer and neighborhood 
from <install-dir>/paradiseo-mo/src to <install-dir>/paradiseo-moeo/src
The default installation directory is 'paradiseo-1.3-beta2'

The model and data used for this implementation is based on Maladis et. al. 
See http://repub.eur.nl/res/pub/20374/ for the description of the model and 
http://repub.eur.nl/res/pub/20375/ contains the data.

To run this ParadisEO implementation: 

1. In 'install.cmake' change the PARADISEO_DIR to the directory where
ParadisEO has been installed. 
2. mkdir build
3. cd build
4. cmake ..
5. make

Then to run NSGA-II:
 ./application/SCN_NSGAII
	you can also run the algorithm with various options, e.g.:
 ./application/SCN_NSGAII --outputFile=results.csv --maxGen=10000
  --popSize=250 --pMut=0.25 --pCross=0.75

To run SPEA2:
 ./applicantion/SCN_SPEA2
	the same options are possible as with NSGA-II
